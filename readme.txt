== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The plugin Requires PHP 5.3 =
__Version 3.x changes requirements for your server. If you upgrade and the upgrade doesn't work for you, you can downgrade to the previous version of the plugin.__

Why? Because [Constant Contact's official code](https://github.com/constantcontact/php-sdk) requires PHP 5.3. 

Ask your host about upgrading your server to 5.3. If they say no, chances are you should find a new host; 5.3 has long been available.

= Do I need a Constant Contact account for this plugin? =
This plugin requires a [Constant Contact account](http://wordpress.constantcontact.com/index.jsp).

Constant Contact is a great email marketing company -- their rates are determined by the number of contacts in your list, not how many emails you send. This means you can send unlimited emails per month for one fixed rate! [Give it a test run](http://wordpress.constantcontact.com/features/signup.jsp).

= Is there shortcode support? =

### Form Shortcode ###

There is shortcode support for the Form Designer forms: `[constantcontactapi]` with the following options:

```
'formid' => 0, // REQUIRED
'before' => null,
'after' => null,
'redirect_url' => false,
'lists' => array(),
'title' => '',
'exclude_lists' => array(),
'description' => '',
'show_list_selection' => false,
'list_selection_title' => 'Add me to these lists:',
'list_selection_format' => 'checkbox'
```

So to add a form, you would add the following in your content: `[constantcontactapi formid="3"]`

### Event Shortcode ###

To show event details, you can use the `[eventspot]` shortcode with the following options:

```
'id' => null, // Show a specific event; enter Event ID (found on the Events page) to use
'limit' => 3, // Number of events to show by default
'showdescription' => true, // Show event Description
'datetime' => true, // Show event Date & Time
'location' => false, // Show event Location
'map' => false,  // Show map link for Location (if Location is shown)
'calendar' => false, // Show "Add to Calendar" link
'directtoregistration' => false, // Link directly to registration page, rather than event homepage
'newwindow' => false, // Open event links in a new window
'style' => true // Use plugin styles. Disable if you want to use your own styles (CSS)
```

__Sample Event Shortcodes__

* To show event details for 5 events using the default settings, you would use `[eventspot limit=3]`
* To show event details for a single event with the id of `abc123` and also show the location details and map link, you would use: `[eventspot id="abc123" location=true map=true]`
* To use your own CSS file, you would use `[eventspot style=false]`


= How do I use the new `apply_filters()` functionality? (Added 1.1) =
If you want to change some code in the widget, you can use the WordPress `add_filter()` function to achieve this.

You can add code to your theme's `functions.php` file that will modify the widget output. Here's an example:

```
function my_example_function($widget) {
	// The $widget variable is the output of the widget
	// This will replace 'this word' with 'that word' in the widget output.
	$widget = str_replace('this word', 'that word', $widget);
	// Make sure to return the $widget variable, or it won't work!
	return $widget;
}
add_filter('constant_contact_form', 'my_example_function');
```

You can modify the widget output by hooking into any of the filters below in a similar manner.

To modify the Events widget output, start with the following code, again in your theme's `functions.php` file:

```
add_filter('cc_event_output_single', 'cc_event_output_single', 1, 2);

function cc_event_output_single($output, $pieces = array('start'=> '','title'=>'','description'=>'','date'=>'','calendar'=>'','location' => '', 'end'=>'')) {
	// The pieces of each event are stored in the $pieces array
	// So you can modify them and cut and paste in what order you
	// want the pieces to display
	return $pieces['start'].'<dt>Description</dt>'.$pieces['description'].$pieces['date'].$pieces['end'];
}
```

__Some example filters:__

* Entire form output: `constant_contact_form`
* Successful submission message: `constant_contact_form_success`
* Form description text: `constant_contact_form_description` (after it has been modified by `wpautop()`)
* Error message: `constant_contact_form_errors`
* Submit button: `constant_contact_form_submit` (includes entire `input` string)

= My email campaign click data isn't being tracked in Constant Analytics =
Constant Contact does not have built-in Google Analytics "tagging" that would track the click data. When you create links in your Constant Contact campaigns, <strong><a href="http://www.google.com/support/analytics/bin/answer.py?answer=55578" rel="nofollow">use the Google URL Builder</a></strong> to add tags to your links. <strong>Make sure to set the Campaign Medium to `email`!</strong>

When you do that, email click stats will be segmented for you in the Site Traffic box.

= How do I use the Form Designer? =

### Using the Form Designer
1. Install this plugin.
2. Activate the Constant Contact API: Form Designer plugin
3. Configure the settings on the form designer by updating the settings in the boxes on the left.

= What is the plugin license? =
Good news, this plugin is free for everyone! The plugin is [licensed under the GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt "View the GPL License").

= How do I test Akismet spam filtering? =

* Add a First Name field to the form you want to test 
* Log out of your site (Akismet takes into account if you're logged-in)
* Submit your form using the First Name field set to `viagra-test-123`
* That should always return false
